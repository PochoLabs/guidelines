# We build great software for companies big and small

## Here's how we do it

[Tallwave](https://tallwave.com) is a **"Digital Innovation Agency"**. That means we help companies turn good ideas into great things. We do this through design, marketing, branding, digital services, and software development. The software we deliver to our client needs to be great, so this series of documents will serve to codify how that process works and how we work as a team.

Nothing is set in stone and all facets of it should be discussed (when appropriate). We are making this public to demonstrate our philosophy.
